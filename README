x2j.go - A utility library for Unmarshal'ing XML docs into a map or a JSON string.

MOTIVATION

I make extensive use of JSON for messaging and typically unmarshal the messages into
map[string]interface{} variables.  This is easily done using json.Unmarshal from the
standard Go libraries.  Unfortunately, many legacy solutions use structured
XML messages; in those environments the applications would have to be refitted to
interoperate with my components.

The better solution is to just provide an alternative HTTP handler that receives
XML doc messages and parses it into a map[string]interface{} variable and then reuse
all the JSON-based code.  The Go xml.Unmarshal() function does not provide the same
option of unmarshaling XML messages into map[string]interface{} variables. So I wrote
a couple of small functions to fill this gap.

Of course, once the XML doc was unmarshal'd into a map[string]interface{} variable it
was just a matter of calling json.Marshal() to provide it as a JSON string.  Hence 'x2j'
rather than just 'x2m'.

USAGE

The package is fairly well self-documented.  The two really useful functions are:

    - DocToMap(s string, recast ...bool) (map[string]interface{}, error)
    - DocToJson(s string, recast ...bool) (string, error)

They do just what they say. Other stuff is there if you want to examine intermediate
results or print out the map in a more readable form than you get printing map values
with 'fmt' library.

To retrieve a value for specific tag use: 

    - DocValue(s, path string, attributes ...string) (interface{}, error)

The 'path' argument is a period-separated tag hierarchy (similar to 'relative variable'
syntax in Websphere MQ Broker ESQL programming).  It is the program's responsibility to
cast the returned value to the proper type; possible types are the normal JSON 
unmarshaling types: string, float64, bool, []interface, map[string]interface{}.  

A couple of parsing conventions:

   - Attributes are parsed to map[string]interface{} values by prefixing a hyphen, '-',
     to the attribute label.
   - If the element is not a complex element and it has attributes, the element value
     is given the key '#text' for its map[string]interface{} representation.  (See
     the 'atomFeedString.xml' test data, below.)

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

Nothing fancy here, just brute force.

   - Use xml.Decoder to parse the XML doc and build a tree.
   - Walk the tree and load values into a map[string]interface{} variable, 'm', as
     appropriate.
   - Use json.Marshaler to convert 'm' to JSON.

As for testing:

   - Copy an XML doc into 'x2j_test.xml'.
   - Run "go test" and you'll get a full dump.
     ("pathTestString.xml" and "atomFeedString.xml" are test data from "read_test.go"
     in the encoding/xml directory of the standard package library.)

USES

   - putting a XML API on our message hub middleware (http://jsonhub.net)
   - loading XML data into NoSQL database, such as, mongoDB
